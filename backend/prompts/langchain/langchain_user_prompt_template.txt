Create a beautiful Christmas story featuring {primary_character} and {secondary_character}.

Guidelines for your story:
- Write 200-300 words that flow naturally
- Focus on the relationship between the two characters
- Include at least one moment of Christmas magic or surprise
- Incorporate traditional Christmas elements (decorations, food, music, snow, etc.)
- Show character growth or realization
- End with hope, joy, or a touching moment
- Use dialogue to bring characters to life

The story should feel authentic and leave readers with warm feelings about the holiday season.
