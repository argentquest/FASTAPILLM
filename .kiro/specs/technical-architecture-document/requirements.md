# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a comprehensive Technical Architecture Document for the FASTAPILLM - AI Content Generation Platform. The document will serve as the definitive reference for understanding the system's architecture, components, data flow, and technical decisions. This documentation is essential for onboarding new developers, system maintenance, architectural reviews, and future enhancements.

The platform is a modern, enterprise-grade AI content generation system featuring multi-framework support (Semantic Kernel, LangChain, LangGraph), MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, comprehensive cost tracking, and full-stack web interface built with FastAPI and React.
