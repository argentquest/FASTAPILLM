Write a Christmas story draft featuring {primary_character} and {secondary_character}.

Create a basic story structure (150-200 words) that includes:
- Setting the Christmas scene
- Introducing both characters
- A central conflict or challenge
- A resolution that brings them together
- Christmas themes of giving, family, or joy

This is just the first draft - focus on getting the core narrative down.
